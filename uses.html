Since each language is different, they may each be better suited for a specific purpose or purposes in specific industries. Some programming languages ​​are used to create programs to solve problems or interpret data. Other programming languages ​​are more suitable for creating entertainment programs or applications. Some examples of languages ​​are used :
<h3>
1-Python is a high-level, object-oriented language and can be used for data mining and visualisation, machine learning, web applications, game development and honestly anything else you can think of — yes, it’s that versatile!

Some of the major organizations and companies that use Python are Google, Pinterest, Instagram, YouTube, DropBox, NASA
<h3>
2-Java is also a high-level, object-oriented language. One of its main draws is that it’s very powerful and secure and so all of the banking application development happens in Java only. It’s perfect for someone looking to work in Android development, Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, or game/desktop app development.Major organizations that use Java are Airbnb, Uber, eBay, Pinterest, Groupon, Spotify, Pandora.
<h3>
3-Ruby Some of the major organizations that use it are Github, Scribd, Groupon, NASA Langley Research Center, Motorola, Google (SketchUp). Basecamp, Amazon, Twitter and Groupon were all created using Ruby on Rails.

Ruby’s founder, Yukihiro Matsumoto, intended it to be “simple in appearance, but it is very complex inside, just like our human body.”
<h3>
4-PHP is a multi-paradigm programming language, designed for creating dynamic web pages that effectively work with databases. It is a general-purpose language and is widely used for Web Application Development, Server-Side Scripting, Command Line Scripting
and Major organizations that use PHP are Facebook, Yahoo, CyberCoders, NextGen
<h3>
5-Go (or Golang) was developed by Google in 2017 to improve programming productivity. It was designed to have the following features :
<h3>
   1-Static typing and run-time efficiency (like C++)
<h3>
   2-Readability and usability (like Python or JavaScript)
<h3>
   3-High-performance networking and multiprocessing
<h3>
 Major organizations that use Go are (obviously) Google, Uber, Basecamp, Medium, Intel and BBC
